# Sample Go API
This is a sample Go API that demonstrates how to build a simple REST API in Go using the Gin framework.

## Requirements
- Go 1.22.5 or later
- Gin
- Go modules
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Make
- Git
- IDE (VS Code, GoLand, etc.)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `make build` to build the Docker image
3. Run `make run` to start the API
4. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## API Endpoints
- GET `/api/v1/health`
- GET `/api/v1/version`
- GET `/api/v1/users`
- GET `/api/v1/users/:id`
- POST `/api/v1/users`
- PUT `/api/v1/users/:id`
- DELETE `/api/v1/users/:id`
